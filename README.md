# üß† Predictive Modelling of Lung Cancer Using IBM SPSS

This project aims to predict the likelihood of lung cancer in individuals based on various medical and lifestyle features. Using **IBM SPSS Statistics**, we performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling to support early detection of lung cancer.

## üìù Results

- **Best Model**: Decision Tree (CHAID)
- **Accuracy**: ~93%
- **Top Predictors**:
  - SMOKING
  - YELLOW_FINGERS
  - COUGHING
  - SHORTNESS OF BREATH
  - CHEST PAIN

These features showed the strongest association with the target class (`LUNG_CANCER`).
