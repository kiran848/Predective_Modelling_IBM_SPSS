üéØ Predictive Modelling of Lung Cancer using IBM SPSS
This project aims to build a predictive model to identify potential lung cancer patients based on health and behavioral attributes. Using IBM SPSS, we apply data preprocessing, visualization, and classification techniques to gain insights and build an effective model for lung cancer prediction.
